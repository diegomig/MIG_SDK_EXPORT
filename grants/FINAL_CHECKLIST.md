## 📋 Pre-Submission Review Checklist

### Content Review

- [ ] Review all PROJECT_PROPOSAL.md for accuracy and completeness
- [ ] Verify budgets sum correctly and align with milestones
- [ ] Check timeline consistency (4-6 months, milestone-based)
- [ ] Verify all links to main repository work correctly
- [ ] Review AI_FIRST_MANIFESTO for consistency across grants

### Grant-Specific Review

**Arbitrum**:
- [ ] Focus on efficiency and low-level optimization (cache, RPC reduction)
- [ ] Verify stress testing plan is comprehensive
- [ ] Check sustainability plan addresses post-grant maintenance

**Uniswap**:
- [ ] Focus on mathematical precision (tick math, SqrtPriceX96)
- [ ] Verify V4 preparation architecture is clear
- [ ] Check maintenance plan addresses V4 launch support
- [ ] Verify mathematical spec addresses precision requirements

**Unichain (via Uniswap scope)**:
- [ ] Ensure Unichain readiness deliverables are clearly scoped under Uniswap (no separate “Base” submission)
- [ ] Ensure wording avoids claiming a separate Unichain grants portal unless explicitly available

### Technical Review

- [ ] Verify all technical documents reference main repo correctly
- [ ] Check that no documents are duplicated unnecessarily
- [ ] Verify README files provide clear navigation
- [ ] Ensure document organization is intuitive
