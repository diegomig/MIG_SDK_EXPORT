# AI-First Methodology Documents

This folder contains documentation about the AI-first development methodology, with focus on mathematical precision for Uniswap implementations.

## Documents

- **[AI_FIRST_MANIFESTO.md](./AI_FIRST_MANIFESTO.md)** - AI-first development methodology (with mathematical precision focus)

## Reference Documents (Main Repository)

Additional methodology documentation is available in the main repository:

- **[AI_WORKFLOW.md](../../../docs/AI_WORKFLOW.md)** - Detailed AI-first workflow documentation
- **[VALIDATION_PROCESS.md](../../../docs/VALIDATION_PROCESS.md)** - Validation and quality assurance process
- **[FLIGHT_RECORDER.md](../../../docs/FLIGHT_RECORDER.md)** - Observability system documentation

## Purpose

These documents explain:
- **How** the SDK was developed (AI-first methodology)
- **Why** this approach works for Uniswap (mathematical precision through multi-model validation)
- **How** quality is ensured (external advisory validation for tick math)
