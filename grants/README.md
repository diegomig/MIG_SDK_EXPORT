## 🎯 Common Themes Across All Grants

### Development Methodology

**Phase 1 (Completed)**: AI-First Development
- Human provides vision, architecture, and validation
- AI handles implementation details and boilerplate
- Multi-model validation for critical decisions
- Documentation-first approach

**Grant-Funded Phase**: External Advisory Validation
- External Rust/DeFi consultants for code review
- Expert validation of critical decisions
- Production-grade quality assurance
- Real-world use case validation

### Timeline & Payment Structure

- **Timeline**: 4-6 months (milestone-based delivery)
- **Payment Structure**: Milestone-based payments (not fixed calendar dates)
- **Flexibility**: Payments released upon milestone completion and verification
- **No Fixed Duration**: Timeline ranges (4-6 months) allow flexibility

### Key Principles

1. **Milestone-Based Delivery**: Clear deliverables and success criteria for each milestone
2. **External Advisory**: Expert validation ensures production-grade quality
3. **Open Source**: MIT OR Apache-2.0 license, public GitHub repository
4. **Documentation**: Comprehensive technical documentation for all deliverables
5. **Community Focus**: Beta testing, community engagement, sustainability plans
